# BreezeButton

## Overview
BreezeButtonis a fork of BreezeEnhanced with the following changes:

 * Redesigned macOS like button

BreezeEnhanced is a fork of KDE Breeze decoration with the following changes:

 * The optional title-bar gradient is smooth and has a configurable intensity.
 * The title-bar opacity is configurable.
 * A very mild light line is added to the top of title-bar (especially for dark color schemes) and the separator between title-bar and window is removed.
 * By default, the close, minimize and maximize buttons are macOS-like and their sizes change on mouse-over when animation is enabled.
 * The spacing between buttons is configurable.
 * Opaqueness, opacity override and flatness are added to the exception list properties.
 * The title-bar font is set independently of the KDE font settings (for use outside KDE).

Please note that BreezeEnhanced is not related to the Breeze widget style. In fact, it is made to match various themes of the [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum) widget style but it works with all styles.

## Credits:

BreezeEnhanced was started from [BreezeBlurred](https://github.com/alex47/BreezeBlurred), a former fork of Breeze with title-bar translucency and blurring.

Needless to say, the main work behind BreezeEnhanced is the Breeze KWin decoration itself, which can be downloaded from <https://download.kde.org/stable/plasma/>.

## Installation

The version number in the file [NEWS](NEWS) shows the main version of KWin that is required for the compilation. *Compilation should not be done against other versions of KWin!*

In what follows, it is supposed that the name of the installation directory of KDE libraries is `lib` and the installation prefix is `/usr`. If they are different in your distro, please replace them!

Open a terminal inside the source directory and do:
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DKDE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON
make
sudo make install
```
After the installation, restart KWin by logging out and in. Then, BreezeEnhanced will appear in *System Settings &rarr; Application Style &rarr; Window Decorations*.
